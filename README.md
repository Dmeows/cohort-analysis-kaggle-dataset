<h2>Cohort Analysis</h2>
<p>In this project, we will explore and analyze data using a technique called Cohort Analysis. Cohort Analysis is a powerful method for evaluating user behavior and understanding their journey over time. By breaking down users into specific cohorts based on shared characteristics, we can uncover valuable insights into their engagement, retention, and overall customer lifecycle.</p>
<h3>What is a Cohort Model?</h3>
<p>A Cohort Model is a framework used to group users who share a common attribute or experience during a specific time period. Cohort Analysis helps us track and compare the behavior of these cohorts as they progress through different stages over time. Here are some key aspects of a Cohort Model:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Cohort:
    </b>A cohort refers to a group of users who share a common characteristic or experience.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Cohort Period:
    </b>The period of time during which users in a cohort first engage with your product or service. This is typically defined as their "signup date" or "first purchase date".</li>
  <li>
    <b>Metrics:
    </b>For each cohort, we analyze various metrics to understand their behavior and compare performance. These metrics can include user retention, average revenue per user, conversion rates, or any other relevant KPIs.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Cohort Analysis:
    </b>This analysis involves tracking and studying the performance and trends of different cohorts over time. It helps us understand how different cohorts behave and how their behavior changes as time progresses.</li>
  <li>
    <b>Retention Curves:
    </b>A retention curve is a graphical representation of the percentage of users from a cohort who remain active over time. It provides valuable insights into the sustainability of user engagement.</li>
</ul>
